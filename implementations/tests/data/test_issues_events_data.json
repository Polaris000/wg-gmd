agree with @GeorgLink. However, maybe we should also have into account issues that are closed without fixing (eg, \"won't fix\"), but that's a bit more tricky (see below).\r\n\r\nI think we can, for now, go with the approach @GeorgLink suggests, but in that case, I would change the name to \"unattended issues\", which is maybe more precise for that case. And is a useful metric, indeed.\r\n\r\nWe can also open a more general discussion about what exactly we want to track. I think this comes from an extension of the concept of \"abandoned reviews\" in Gerrit. There, it has a very precise meaning: reviews that were closed as \"abandoned\", meaning that the proposer of the patch is no longer working on it (thus, abandoning the patch, and signalling reviewers that no review is needed).\r\n\r\nBut for issues, that meaning is maybe difficult to capture, because it would be when somebody opens a ticket, and because whatever the reason, closes it before it is fixed.

issues being open, it is the ratio close/open what matters. In that case, it is not relevant why the issue was closed.\r\n* If you're interested in how much you are fixing problems, yes, your definition is more accurate. But AFAIK, there is no way, at least in some issue trackers, such as GitHub's, to determine if an issue was closed with a fix or not. Besides, there are issues that you really don't need to fix (such as questions).\r\n\r\nSo, I would stick to the definition I proposed above.","created_at":"2018-05-25T09:29:20Z","html_url":"https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/5#issuecomment-391996980","id":391996980,"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/5","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTk5Njk4MA==","reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/comments/391996980/reactions"},"reactions_data":[],"updated_at":"2018-05-25T09:29:20Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/comments/391996980","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1039693?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/jgbarah","id":1039693,"login":"jgbarah","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk2OTM=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah"},"user_data":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1039693?v=4","bio":null,"blog":"http://gsyc.es/~jgb","company":null,"created_at":"2011-09-09T21:47:40Z","email":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/events{/privacy}","followers":88,"followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/followers","following":0,"following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","hireable":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/jgbarah","id":1039693,"location":null,"login":"jgbarah","name":"Jesus M.

the absence of a pr does not always mean the bug was not fixed (it depends on whether the project is using always prs, and how they are using them). Besides, if the ticket was not about a real bug (bug a question, for example), you really don't need to close it by fixing anything.\r\n\r\nSo, I would stick to issues closed / issues open per month. That has a clear interpretation in terms of throughput (if < 1, the project is not coping with all the opening activity), and is easy to compute.\r\n\r\nIf you want, we can later explore some metric related to actually fixing bugs, but I think that should at least some discipline by the project (such as consistently using pull requests, and using \"bug\" tag in issues, for example). But I'd leave this to a later step.\r\n\r\n@GeorgLink I completely agree with you and @aswanipranjal on having closed in the numerator.\r\n\r\nFor abandoned issues, given that we really don't know if they are abandoned, or just inactive, I would use `inactive`. In fact, for being more precise, it could be `inactive-period`, such as for example `inactive-30d' (meaning inactive for 30 at least days, as of now).\r\n\r\nSo, if you agree, it would be:\r\n\r\n* `inactive-period` issues (we could for now settle on `inactive-30d`). Issues that as of now have been inactive (no comment) for `period` time.\r\n*  `inactive-period` pull requests (we could for now settle on `inactive-30d`). Pull request that as of now have been inactive (no comment) for `period` time.\r\n*  `efficiency-period` for issues (we could for now settle on `efficiency-30d').

Issues closed: are those the same issues that were opened, but whether they were closed at any time after their creation? Or are issues closed the ones that were closed during that time period but could have been created before? The problem with the latter is that when we receive no new issues but close 1, then we have an undefined fraction of 1/0 ...\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the metric which is useful is \"how much you close during this period related to how much is open\". If you're closing less than it is opened (whenever the closed stuff was opened), you're accumulating work for the future. If you're closing more than is opened (whenever the closed stuff was opened), you're shortening the queue of pending work. For the metric to be this way, you need to consider all tickets closed. \r\n\r\nWhy not \"closed bugs that were open during the period\"? Because usually it doesn't matter for this when the bug was open. A closed bug is a closed bug: less technical debt, work done. If we only consider issues open during the current period, we're somehow favoring issues open during some \"artificial\" period, when computing throughput. Besides, we also have metrics on how long does it take to close issues to know about if bugs are being closed quickly or not...\r\n\r\nI see the problem you mention. If we want to avoid it, we need to have a more elaborate metric, which is never zero in the denominator. A simple way of doing that is \"issues open - issues closed\", but that's not relative. For making it relative, you need to divide by something which gives you an idea of the total amount of work... What about using \"bugs still open at the beginning of the period plus bugs open during the period\"? That would be zero only if there were no bugs open during the period and no pending bugs when the period starts, but in that case, there will be no closed bugs either, so it would be 0/0 which we could assume to be 0 (not fully correct, but maybe fair enough). And it would be a weird case, anyway.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, the metric would be \"total number of bugs closed during the period / (total number of bugs opened during the period + total number of bugs open at the beginning of the period). In this case, the interpretation would be: the closer to 1, the less bugs remaining open at the end of the period the project is coping well with pending work), the closer to 0, the more bugs remaining open (the project is not coping well with pending work). If the number remains stable over time, project is closing at about the same pace (relative to the pending work), if it decreases, the project is closing less stuff than it should be closing...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-06T22:03:33Z","html_url":"https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/5#issuecomment-395228792","id":395228792,"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/5","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTIyODc5Mg==","reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/comments/395228792/reactions"},"reactions_data":[],"updated_at":"2018-06-06T22:08:21Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/comments/395228792","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1039693?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/jgbarah","id":1039693,"login":"jgbarah","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk2OTM=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah"},"user_data":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1039693?v=4","bio":null,"blog":"http://gsyc.es/~jgb","company":null,"created_at":"2011-09-09T21:47:40Z","email":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/events{/privacy}","followers":88,"followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/followers","following":0,"following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","hireable":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/jgbarah","id":1039693,"location":null,"login":"jgbarah","name":"Jesus M.

This captures the effect that maybe throughput is sort of good, because the project is focusing on closing bugs which are recent, but ignoring for longer and longer periods bugs that are old (and maybe difficult to close). The backlog can also be absolute or relative, and usually (in my opinion) relative is more useful. Following the spirit of the discussion above, it would be something like \"total number of bugs still open at the end of the period / (total number of bugs opened during the period + total number of bugs open at the beginning of the period).  If the number is larger than 1, the backlog is increasing. If it is lower than 1, the backlog is decreasing.","created_at":"2018-06-06T22:14:28Z","html_url":"https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/5#issuecomment-395231146","id":395231146,"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/5","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTIzMTE0Ng==","reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/comments/395231146/reactions"},"reactions_data":[],"updated_at":"2018-06-06T22:14:28Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/comments/395231146","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1039693?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/jgbarah","id":1039693,"login":"jgbarah","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk2OTM=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah"},"user_data":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1039693?v=4","bio":null,"blog":"http://gsyc.es/~jgb","company":null,"created_at":"2011-09-09T21:47:40Z","email":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/events{/privacy}","followers":88,"followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/followers","following":0,"following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbarah/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","hireable":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/jgbarah","id":1039693,"location":null,"login":"jgbarah","name":"Jesus M.

For these metrics, I merely copy-pasted the template and changed the title and came up with a description based on metric's name - nothing too concrete, just a rudimentary/naive idea upon which we can further improve. \r\n\r\nIf there needs to be a specific format for a PR, or if something is missing, please let me know.
